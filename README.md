# Lerner

A simple way to learn stuff that you had (sadly) written into Google Sheets.

## I want to try it!

## Local development

First install `yarn` (use `yarn`, please) and `elm`. Find the instructions to do that yourself, you lazy fuck. If you can acomplish that, you ought to receive a pat on your head from me.

To start the local server, run `yarn start`.
To build the app, run `yarn build`.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Carla Thomas, Marlena Shaw, Aretha Franklin and many other great women for recording the songs I'd listened to while programming this web thingy. Listen to them [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EQntZpEGgfBif?si=7ea2118b944347ac).
